Students will be expected to apply the rationale behind the possible complications with each surgery, thus enabling them to be involved in client education. During the laboratory sessions, students work in small groups becoming proficient in delivering anaesthesia to animals, performing surgical assistance with aseptic instrument handling with the veterinarian, and practice surgical nursing, and post-operative care to the patient. Students will develop skills such as proper placement and care of an intravenous indwelling catheter for anesthetized animals, collection of patient blood to perform a pre-surgical serum chemistry profile along with applying the theoretical principles of anesthesia.\n\nRestriction(s):\nRegistration in the Associate Diploma in Veterinary Technology Conventional or Alternative program.\nDepartment(s):\nRidgetown Academic",
