Students will explore the agri-food system by tracing consumer end-products back to primary production. Modern, industrial agri-food systems as well as subsistence farming will be discussed. The course incorporates an experiential learning component in which students will explore a new agri-food opportunity for Ontario by designing and assessing the value chain.\n\nRestriction(s):\nAGR*1100.

        "Description": "Territory occupies a significant place in the discourses on art and material culture. Key lines of inquiry related to territory include the physical, symbolic, and theoretical capturing of terrain; the creation of political, economic, environmental, social, spiritual, and intellectual domains; its potential to express human emotion and experience; and the global intermedial exchanges associated with its (re)configurations. In this course, students will explore the cultural landscapes that have helped to shape the development of artistic practice over time.\n\nRestriction(s):\nARTH*2600\nDepartment(s):\nSchool of Fine Art and Music",

Students will derive an understanding of the biological foundation of their own health as an adult and will be encouraged to expand the concepts and processes of individual health to human populations, animals and the environment. Through lectures, laboratories, small group tutorials and an individual research project, students will gain an introduction to research in the health sciences. Students lacking Grade 12 or 4U Biology should consult with their program counsellor prior to taking BIOL*1080 in first semester.\n\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Human Health and Nutritional Sciences",

        "Description": "This course will foster an understanding of key concepts in molecular and cell biology and genetics including evolution, relationship between structure and function, energy and regulation, interrelatedness of life, and the nature of science. By relating these concepts to their daily lives, through analysis of problems and tutorial discussions, students will develop an understanding of five central themes: 1) all living things share common properties, 2) the cell is the fundamental functional unit of life, 3) managing energy is central to success, 4) genes are the fundamental information unit of life, and 5) heredity. Students lacking Grade 12 or 4U Biology should consult with their program counsellor prior to taking BIOL*1090 in first semester.\n\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Molecular and Cellular Biology",

        "Description": "This course provides the foundational skills required to model and analyze elementary dynamic engineering systems. The course will focus on basic mechanical, electrical, thermal and hydraulic systems under the assumptions of linearity and time invariance. Students will learn to identify relevant elements and generate system models. System behaviours will be analyzed by solving for such responses as the impulse response, step response, and sinusoidal steady-state response using differential equations, Laplace transform methods, and computer-based methods. The relationship of such system parameters as time constant, degree of damping and resonance frequencies with the transient and steady-state responses will be examined. The complex valued system transfer function will be defined and analyzed.\n\nRestriction(s):\nNon-BENG students may take a maximum of 4.00 ENGG credits.\nDepartment(s):\nSchool of Engineering",

Design, synthesis and realization of sequential circuits. VHDL: structural modeling, data flow modeling, synchronous & asynchronous behavior descriptions, algorithmic modeling. Designing with PLDs. Digital design with SM charts. Designing with PGAs and complex programmable logical devices. Hardware testing and design for testability. Hierarchy in large designs. The course will primarily be concerned with the design of multi-input, multi-output digital controllers which provide the central control signals that orchestrate the collection of hardware devices (from SSI to VLSI) found in a digital system. An introduction to FPGA-based, as well as microprocessor-based digital systems design will be given. Design examples will include systems such as UART, microcontroller CPU, ALU and data acquisition system.\n\nRestriction(s):\nThis is a Priority Access Course.

The free and forced response of these systems will be covered. Emphasis will be placed on the design of vibration suppression and isolation of mechanical systems. Concepts of natural frequencies and mode shapes and their significance in the solution of multiple degrees of freedom problems will be covered. Vibration of rotating machinery, balancing, condition monitoring, and predictive vs. preventative maintenance philosophies will be introduced.\n\nRestriction(s):\nNon-BENG students may take a maximum of 4.00 ENGG credits.\nDepartment(s):\nSchool of Engineering",

The material covered includes architectural styles, case studies, architectural design techniques, formal models, specifications and architectural design tools.

Students will critically reflect on such questions as how law and legal processes shape and are shaped by broader social and political power dynamics, the degree to which law is \"political\"; and how the framing of the issue and solutions during the simulation in terms of law and justice created strategies, goals, and outcomes that may be distinct from other social and political approaches to the issue.\n\nRestriction(s):\nRestricted to students in BAH.JLS and BAH.JLS:C.\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Political Science",

Topics include relations and functions, number systems including formal properties of the natural numbers, integers, and the real and complex numbers. Equivalence relations and partial and total orders are introduced. The geometry and topology of the real number line and Cartesian plane are introduced. Techniques of formal proof are introduced including well-ordering, mathematical induction, proof by contradiction, and proof by construction. These techniques will be applied to fundamental theorems from linear algebra.\n\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Mathematics and Statistics",

The course may include treatment of controversial ethical issues such as abortion, euthanasia, war, and the treatment of animals and will cover many of the following questions: can we expect to find a single, universal code of ethics that applies to all human beings, or do such codes vary for each society or even for each individual? What are the roles of reason and emotion in ethics? Is morality grounded on a principle, and if so, what is it? Are there any traits of character that one must have to be a good person? Given that traditional ethical codes have been almost universally sexist, how must ethics be refashioned in order for women to achieve equal recognition?\n\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Philosophy",
