Students will explore the agri-food system by tracing consumer end-products back to primary production. Modern, industrial agri-food systems as well as subsistence farming will be discussed. The course incorporates an experiential learning component in which students will explore a new agri-food opportunity for Ontario by designing and assessing the value chain.\n\nRestriction(s):\nAGR*1100.

Students will derive an understanding of the biological foundation of their own health as an adult and will be encouraged to expand the concepts and processes of individual health to human populations, animals and the environment. Through lectures, laboratories, small group tutorials and an individual research project, students will gain an introduction to research in the health sciences. Students lacking Grade 12 or 4U Biology should consult with their program counsellor prior to taking BIOL*1080 in first semester.\n\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Human Health and Nutritional Sciences",

        "Description": "This course will foster an understanding of key concepts in molecular and cell biology and genetics including evolution, relationship between structure and function, energy and regulation, interrelatedness of life, and the nature of science. By relating these concepts to their daily lives, through analysis of problems and tutorial discussions, students will develop an understanding of five central themes: 1) all living things share common properties, 2) the cell is the fundamental functional unit of life, 3) managing energy is central to success, 4) genes are the fundamental information unit of life, and 5) heredity. Students lacking Grade 12 or 4U Biology should consult with their program counsellor prior to taking BIOL*1090 in first semester.\n\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Molecular and Cellular Biology",

        "Description": "This course provides the foundational skills required to model and analyze elementary dynamic engineering systems. The course will focus on basic mechanical, electrical, thermal and hydraulic systems under the assumptions of linearity and time invariance. Students will learn to identify relevant elements and generate system models. System behaviours will be analyzed by solving for such responses as the impulse response, step response, and sinusoidal steady-state response using differential equations, Laplace transform methods, and computer-based methods. The relationship of such system parameters as time constant, degree of damping and resonance frequencies with the transient and steady-state responses will be examined. The complex valued system transfer function will be defined and analyzed.\n\nRestriction(s):\nNon-BENG students may take a maximum of 4.00 ENGG credits.\nDepartment(s):\nSchool of Engineering",

Design, synthesis and realization of sequential circuits. VHDL: structural modeling, data flow modeling, synchronous & asynchronous behavior descriptions, algorithmic modeling. Designing with PLDs. Digital design with SM charts. Designing with PGAs and complex programmable logical devices. Hardware testing and design for testability. Hierarchy in large designs. The course will primarily be concerned with the design of multi-input, multi-output digital controllers which provide the central control signals that orchestrate the collection of hardware devices (from SSI to VLSI) found in a digital system. An introduction to FPGA-based, as well as microprocessor-based digital systems design will be given. Design examples will include systems such as UART, microcontroller CPU, ALU and data acquisition system.\n\nRestriction(s):\nThis is a Priority Access Course. Enrolment may be restricted to the CENG and ESC specializations in the BENG and BENG:C programs. See department for more information.

Topics studied include: effective stress, consolidation, shear strength and lateral earth pressure. Theory is applied to geotechnical problems such as settlement and stability of earth slopes. Students will gain an understanding of approaches to site investigation and will perform testing in the field and laboratory to characterize soil properties. Students will have an opportunity to use software tools that support problem analysis and design.\n\nRestriction(s):\nNon-BENG students may take a maximum of 4.00 ENGG credits.\nDepartment(s):\nSchool of Engineering",

The course provides an introduction to insect sampling, observation, identification, and experimentation in field settings. Student activities are divided equally between observing, collecting and identifying specimens from more than 20 families and an experimental component involving one or more studies to test hypotheses about the ecology or behaviour of insects. There are occasional lectures and discussions to highlight particularly interesting observations of insects. Student evaluation is based on the student's insect collection and associated logbook, a written paper describing their experiment, contributions to class discussions and activities, and peer evaluation. The field site is generally in the USA or South America. Course fees cover costs of room, board, supplies, and transportation to the field site(s). This course must be recorded as part of the student's Fall or Winter course selection and tuition and compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly.

This course will explore this issue by taking a global and historic perspective to understand the structure and functioning of agriculture and food systems. We will pay particular attention to the interaction of farms with social, economic, institutional and environmental forces that combine to shape patterns of agricultural activity. In particular, we will explore ways of assessing the extent to which different kinds of food systems are \"sustainable\" as well as assess how resilient and robust these food systems are to environmental problems (such as climate change) and economic upheaval.\n\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Geography, Environment and Geomatics",

Students will critically reflect on such questions as how law and legal processes shape and are shaped by broader social and political power dynamics, the degree to which law is \"political\"; and how the framing of the issue and solutions during the simulation in terms of law and justice created strategies, goals, and outcomes that may be distinct from other social and political approaches to the issue.\n\nRestriction(s):\nRestricted to students in BAH.JLS and BAH.JLS:C.\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Political Science",

The course may include treatment of controversial ethical issues such as abortion, euthanasia, war, and the treatment of animals and will cover many of the following questions: can we expect to find a single, universal code of ethics that applies to all human beings, or do such codes vary for each society or even for each individual? What are the roles of reason and emotion in ethics? Is morality grounded on a principle, and if so, what is it? Are there any traits of character that one must have to be a good person? Given that traditional ethical codes have been almost universally sexist, how must ethics be refashioned in order for women to achieve equal recognition?\n\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Philosophy",

We will study how these groups have shared rapid culture change, marginalization, and absorption into colonial societies with little regard to their autonomy. These cultural dislocations have been linked to high rates of depression, substance abuse, suicide, and violence in many communities. There will be a focus on culture-through language, land, and tradition-as treatment.

The remainder of the course will be organized around specific contemporary problems in vertebrate biology such as the evolution of endothermy; feeding strategies and metabolism; locomotion and migration; trends in vertebrate reproduction; evolution of brain size and complexity in relation to cognition and communication. Each problem will be explored through analyses of taxonomic diversity, historical and phylogenetic constraints, physiological and developmental causes, and functional effects.\n\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Integrative Biology",
